# Snake Game Project

## Scope of the project
This was a semester long course project for the course Programming 3 (BMEVIIIAB00) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, which I made during the 3. semester of my Bachelor's there.

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game using Java. The game allows one or two players to control snakes, navigate through a grid, and eat treats while avoiding collisions with walls and themselves.

## Technical Elements
Programming Language: Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Utilized OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to design modular and extensible code.
Implemented classes to represent various game elements, including snakes, treats, and the game table.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Developed the game's graphical interface using Java Swing, allowing for interactive gameplay and user-friendly controls.
Designed custom components such as buttons, text fields, and panels to create a visually appealing game setup window and end game results display.
- File Handling
Implemented file handling to store and load player scores in a JSON file, enabling persistent storage of game statistics.
Utilized the Jackson library for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Game Logic
Implemented game logic to handle player movement, collision detection, treat consumption, and end game conditions.
Integrated timers to control snake movement speed and facilitate smooth gameplay.
- Event Handling
Implemented event listeners to handle user input from keyboard and mouse actions, allowing players to control the snakes and navigate menus.
- Data Structures
Utilized various data structures such as maps, linked lists and arrays to manage game elements efficiently.
Used vectors and arrays to store player scores and maintain the game table's state.

## Documentation
A well-detailed documentation including UML charts can be found in the docs folder.

## Authorship
The entire project was developed by Bal√°zs Hain including: design, graphics, implementation and documentation.
